***TODO***
-Make this into a calculator taking commands in base m and outputting in 
 base n
-Make this into a web interface!! Will command line work or will it have to be
 parameters?
-Work on command line interface. Just ./base 10 16 256 (should print 100)
        -Keep ./base functionality - if argc == 1
